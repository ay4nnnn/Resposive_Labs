        <p>
          My name is Ayan Bashir, I was born in Pakistan and lived there for the
          first two years of my life. After that I immigrated to the U.S. with
          my mom. Since then I have lived in cambridge and visited a few times.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before CRLS I went to PAUS, and then before that MLK. I have 2 younger
          siblings, my brother is now a sophmore here at CRLS and my sister is
          in grade 5 at King Open elementary. My favorite cartoon growing up was
          Avater: the last airbender.

            <p>
              I plan on attending on going to a four year college, perferably in
              the boston area. I want to pursue computer science in the future
              and by taking this class I am planning to reach it. My dream
              college is probably Tufts or Northeastern which I will be trying
              to get into this fall.
